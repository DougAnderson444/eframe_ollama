# Ollama Launcher

Spawns a new Linux OS thread and runs Ollama in it using Tokio.

Kills the processes with `ollama` in the name when it gets the signal.

## TODO:

- [ ] Other OS (Window, Mac)
- [ ] Flag tokio feature?
- [ ] Use [https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-shell](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-shell) as insipiration for robust/better handling.
